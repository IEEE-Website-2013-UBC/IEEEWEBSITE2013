					<br>We want students to gain stronger knowledge of what the biomedical engineering industry is like and to expose to them the responsibilities that biomedical engineers have to take when developing medical products.	
						<br>To this end, we have toured medical companies such as Verathon Medical, McKesson and Kardium.

          <p>The IEEE UBC Student Branch PES team works to advance knowledge by providing a communication stream between students and industry.  This year the team provided this communication channel through social events and site visits.  The team hosted a Student & Industry Networking Event first term and several site visits second term.  There were four site visits second term including Powertech Labs and UBC North Substation.  
			  <br>Receiving great feedback from students and industry we have generated demand for future PES events.  It is safe to say that we have had a successful year in starting to bridge the gap between education and industry and look forward to another great year.

          <p>Think Engineering (TE) is an annual networking event organized and hosted by the IEEE Student Branches at UBC, SFU and BCIT in conjunction with the UBC Electrical and Computer Engineering Student Society. TE2014 team is the largest team with 22 members aiming for one single goal: to deliver the best and improved Think Engineering up to date. Think Engineering aims to connect and engage students in Greater Vancouver with industry representatives from various field of engineering.

<br>The seventh annual Think Engineering event was held at Pan Pacific Vancouver, with over 270 participants. We managed to secure 9 direct sponsors, more than what we achieved in the past years, with addition of 5 more participating companies. The event went very well, and feedback received from both students and industry representatives clearly indicate our success this year and their intention of going/sponsoring again in the years to come.
