<p>      The Wireless Solutions Completion is a design competition that was introduced by Dr. Dave Michelson, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UBC. The process of the competition encourages students to work in a real-life problem solving environment and provides a unique and exciting opportunity for students who are interested in challenging a wireless problem from different perspectives.</p>

<p>The objective of the Wireless Solutions Competition is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stimulate interest in the use of wireless technology to help university departments, clubs, and other campus organizations serve their members and achieve their goals</li>
<li>Help students develop their ability to identify potential applications of new technologies.</li>
<li>Help students develop their ability to prepare and present concise and well-considered proposals regarding technical topics.</li>
</ol>

<p>Students will submit a proposal about a new service, application or research that will make the UBC Wireless Network (or other wireless access services that campus users have access to) more useful to university departments, clubs and other campus organizations. Students with the best proposals will have the opportunity to present their solutions in front of a judging panel consisting of industry professionals that will evaluate their presentation and submission.</p>
